MY VIMRC
=========

This started as my vimrc for windows but into development, I realised that it worked actually better than my original .vimrc for linux. 
So I present to you, fully cross-compatible vimrc for linux and Windows.

All you need to do is replace your vimrc with this one. It installs vim-plug if it isn't installed and starts the installation of plugins. __AWESOME!__

Path : 

   ~/.vimrc for linux

   $HOME/.vimrc or $HOME/_vimrc for windows
     

For windows, you need to install git and curl before running vim with this vimrc.


Install plugins from inside vim by running the command
```
:PlugInstall
```
